                  <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday present some of the best opportunities to buy a flagship smartphone
                    at a significant discount. Many deals are even better than buying a secondhand phone, plus include
                    the added benefit of avoiding the risk of a used product. These phones are new in box, guaranteed to
                    work, and include the manufacturer’s warranty.&nbsp;<br></p>



                  <p>Below you will see multiple discounts for flagship Android smartphones by various manufacturers and
                    deals on Apple devices as well:<br></p>



                  <p><strong>1. Google Pixel 3A and 3A XL: Google’s affordable offering</strong></p>



                  <p>The Google Pixel 3A and 3A XL variant are the discount options to the premium Pixel 4 and Pixel 4
                    XL. Although already sold at a modest price point starting at $399, there are even cheaper options
                    this Black Friday. Amazon is offering the Pixel 3A for $299 for a factory unlocked device. They will
                    also be selling the 3A XL for $379. This discount is straight off MSRP, meaning no contracts or
                    bonus gift cards to hassle with.<br></p>



                  <p><strong>2. Samsung Galaxy S10: The undisputed king of android smartphones</strong></p>



                  <p>The Samsung Galaxy S10 is the definitive anti-iPhone option. As one of the best Android smartphones
                    on the market, Black Friday deals are sure to sell out fast. Best Buy is offering the best deal on
                    this device, granting up to $500 off the Galaxy S10 with an upgrade. With a trade in of an older
                    phone this can go as high as $750 off. The discount will depend on the device being purchased and
                    the device being traded in and reflects on the monthly price of the phone.<br></p>



                  <p><strong>3. OnePlus 7 Pro: Excellent value for the money</strong></p>



                  <p>The OnePlus 7 Pro is a flagship phone that is not sold at typical flagship prices. Starting at $699
                    from the manufacturer, this phone is also being marked down for Black Friday. The best deal can be
                    found direct from OnePlus’s website where they are offering $150 off the price of the phone. Like
                    the deal on the Google Pixel phones, this is a straight cash discount off the purchase price. One of
                    the best phones of 2019 can be had for only $549.<br></p>



                  <p><strong>4. Sony Xperia 1: The most advanced technology in a smartphone</strong></p>



                  <p>The Sony Xperia 1 features a true 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio designed for watching movies and
                    reading web articles. With HDR support on its 4K resolution OLED display, every single thing you
                    look at on this smartphone will be beautiful. Retailing at $950, this device will be marked down to
                    prices as low as $799 during the week of Black Friday at multiple retailers.<br></p>



                  <p><strong>5. Apple iPhones: The biggest smartphone of all time</strong></p>



                  <p>Everyone knows what the Apple iPhone brings to the table. This dominant phone has nearly every
                    model and version discounted for this year’s Black Friday sales. Verizon Wireless is offering $700
                    off the iPhone 11, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max when you buy one at
                    retail price. For consumers looking for a more affordable option, Walmart is offering the iPhone 7
                    for $199 and the iPhone 6S for just $99.<br></p>
