                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From branded t-shirts and USB sticks to coffee mugs and Frisbees notes with corporate logos, do you tend to keep your “swag” when you get home from a business trip or just throw away?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swag” is by definition the free items companies give away to promote their organizations, products, and brands. Companies usually offer swag en masse to participants in corporate events and conferences, but some give away swag as a way to promote brands to customers as well. There’s definitely truth behind the saying, “no swag is created equal”, but your corporate promotional items also don’t have be boring…</span></p>
        <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paper products</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to promoting your business to other businesses who might use them, think practicality via office-related swag items, like branded Post-It notes, pens, and moleskine notebooks. Paper taking items, like moleskine notebooks offer a swag item that can be purchased in bulk in the company colors and then branded with the logo. Pass them out at conferences, and attendees will likely use them, and take them home, after the event.</span></p>
        <ol start="2">
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Water bottles</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bustling around a business conference can make you really thirsty. That’s why reusable water bottles are valued and touted swag items at conferences. They offer the convenience of rehydration on the go, and encourage attendees to remember your brand long after the conference. </span></p>
        <ol start="3">
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Universal chargers</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone, and I mean everyone brings a smartphone or tablet with them to a business conferences. And they use them all day long. So you can imagine how thrilling it would be for someone to offer up a universal charger as swag, just as you’re running low on battery life. Plus, chances are that charger will be reused, and your logo exposed to them, long after the conference is done. </span></p>
        <ol start="4">
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Snacks</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From bags of coffee beans to company-branded candy, a great way to get noticed is by feeding people. Folks generally take a liking to those who offer them yummy snacks, and in the midst of a busy business conference, offering branded food as swag will get a lot of appreciation. So think broad when it comes to edible swag, and choose popular snacks without risk of food allergies (i.e., peanuts). </span></p>
        <ol start="5">
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Branding clothing</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tshirts, mittens, scarves, socks, and sweatshirts. All offer the canvass for your cool logo design and company slogan, even if they don’t know who the heck you are or what you do.Give out t-shirts as swag and chances are your logo will be worn in many different contexts, and even cities, outside of the original business or promotional event.</span></p>
