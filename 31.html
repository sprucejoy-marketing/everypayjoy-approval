<p>You can trade the ones you already have for those you want. No cash, just barter. And it’s yours to keep until you want to exchange it again for another title.</p>

<p>While there are online resources that offer free e-books, this post, however, will focus on the physical books given for free.</p>

<p>WHERE YOU CAN GET FREE BOOKS BY MAIL?</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are some of the best online resources that offer opportunities to get free books.</p>

<p>1. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library</p>
<p>Looking for the easiest place to get a children’s book for free via mail?</p>

<p>Check out Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.</p>

<p>Created by the popular country music singer and songwriter, this non-profit organization offers the easiest opportunity to obtain free books.</p>

<p>Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library’s mission is to https://imaginationlibrary.com/promote literacy during early childhood, focusing on giving kids up to five years old a free book.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the wonderful organization sent over 109 million books for kids. All of that for free.</p>

<p>Wondering how to sign up to get the free stuff?</p>

<p>Go to the organization’s website. There you can see how it works and look for books that are available.</p>

<p>When you join Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, you will get free books every month; it’s a specially aged book that goes to your doorstep. It’s free and no strings attached.</p>

<p>At the moment, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library only offers this free service to select areas in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Australia.</p>

<p>With its exceptional program and a wide selection of free books up for grabs, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is by far the best online resource to score free books by mail.</p>

<p>2. GoodReads</p>
<p>Would you like to be one of the first to read the new titles?</p>

<p>Get access to free pre-released books that are up for grabs by its authors and publishers when you sign up with GoodReads.</p>

<p>Don’t have a GoodReads account?</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you get one now.</p>

<p>GoodReads is a great website that lets you check out new titles as well as the oldies but goldies.</p>

<p>This fantastic online resource lets you in on the books you already read as well as find hundreds more. GoodReads offers recommendations for new titles based on the books you have in your reading history.</p>

<p>Here’s the cool part.</p>

<p>You can sign up for an account with GoodReads for free.</p>

<p>Then go to the giveaways section and search for titles that you like.</p>

<p>At any moment, authors and publishers offer a number of books for free in exchange for a review.</p>

<p>But as there are more people requesting, copies of these free books tend to run out. As a result, not everyone can be accommodated.</p>

<p>To get greater chances of picking up freebies, send out more requests. That way, your luck increases and you can snag a free book.</p>

<p>3. Bibles Of America</p>
<p>Get a free religious Christian book when you sign up with Bibles of America.</p>

<p>To join this service, simply click on the “order for free” option on its website.</p>

<p>No credit card registration will be required. It’s 100-percent free.</p>

<p>The only request is that you order the free Christian book for yourself.</p>

<p>Bible for America also offers free ebooks in addition to the printed giveaways.</p>

<p>4. LibraryThing</p>
<p>Some authors are looking for people to review their work. To this end, they will send copies of their finished work to those who may be interested to provide a book review.</p>

<p>If this is something you’re willing to do, check out LibraryThing.</p>

<p>While it’s not a guarantee that you can score a free title by mail, a lot of authors on LibraryThing will give you a copy in exchange for a book review. No payment is needed on your end.</p>

<p>LibraryThing provides a wonderful platform for people who are looking to try out a new title.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of new books, sign up your name to LibraryThing’s request list. Indicate the type or title of the book that you want.</p>

<p>Please note, however, that there is no guarantee that you will receive a copy. Most of the books may have a lot of people requesting them more than the number of available copies.</p>

<p>My advice is to sign up for as many titles as you can. Ideally, request for 20 to 30 books. This way, your chances of getting a free one significantly increases.</p>

<p>At any given time, LibraryThing features 50 to 100 titles on its list of free books to give away. So you’ll have plenty of choices.</p>

<p>Go ahead and click on that ad to see its details. To snag your freebies, simply follow the directions posted in the ad.</p>
