                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies have implemented time tracking software in order to keep effective records of how time is spent. If you’re a client-based organization, employee time tracking can help staff work as efficiently as possible. If you are a large company with an employee base that works in different offices, or remotely, a time tracking software platform can track when employees are are most productive, and when your company is most profitable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
        </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
        </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track your employee time effectively and discover the following organizational benefits:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.Make the most of the work day</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses report that after implementing time-tracking software, employees are more productive. For instance, with one time tracking platform, at least you know staff will spend less time trying to figure out and input hours into an inefficient, dispersed system.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.Pinpoint inefficiencies</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to time-tracking data gleaned from time tracking software, many businesses say they’ve discovered where inefficiencies exist within the business, and taken the steps to correct this. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creates reliable data</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many employees may see time tracking as insulting. However, time tracking software creates a reliable paper trail for various business reasons. For instance, time tracking can prove beneficial at tax time, when you need a record of hours spent on a certain project. Or tracking time can provide data on a certain employees work hours, for payroll data and bonuses. </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Employee focus</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you employees focusing their time on the right tasks? Optimizing all employees on one time tracking software platform, not only keeps your employees focused and on task for longer stretches, but also decreases the time they spend inputting data into inefficient time tracking software, helping them be more productive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Employee pay and promotions</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time tracking can be a great benefit to employees as well as business owners. For instance, recording time accurately shows who’s working hardest, who should be paid more, and even provides an idea of who should be promoted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
