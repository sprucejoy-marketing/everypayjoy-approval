<p>Sometimes “newer, betters” emerge because the original recipe wasn’t as good as it could be. But most of them — like this — come from real life. Like, when you’re really tired on a Saturday morning and you look at a recipe that you swore by at some time in your life when nobody dragged you out of bed at 7am on a Saturday [and then, instead of handing you a cup of coffee for your troubles, as you’d once daydreamed they’d be trained to do by now, demanded pancakes] and say “WHUT.” A blender? No, I am definitely not getting the blender out right now. Wait, why am I turning on the stove <em>and</em> the oven? Do I really need <em>this</em> much butter? Why are there lumps in the batter? Why isn’t this as puffy as I thought it would be? Can I go back to bed yet? I mean, just for a random example that’s definitely not going down in my kitchen as we speak.</p>

<p>In the early days of this site, I told you about what my mom’s 1970s blender recipe insert called <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/loopy-breakfast-goodness/">German Pancakes</a>, confusing many German friends and readers, who had never heard of them. We better know these as Dutch babies — equally confusing, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_baby_pancake">said to have been coined</a> by a corruption of the German <em>deutsch</em> — or David Eyre’s Pancakes, but they’re closer to popovers or Yorkshire puddings than anything else in batter. Because dramatic, rumpled crepe-like pancakes will always be more exciting than undramatic, unrumpled crepes, I’ve made a lot of versions over the years: <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2012/01/buckwheat-baby-with-salted-caramel-syrup/">buckwheat</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2014/06/cherry-almond-dutch-baby/">cherry-almond</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2017/01/chocolate-dutch-baby/">chocolate</a> on the site; gingerbread (in <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/books/">The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook</a>) and a parmesan dutch baby with creamed mushrooms (in <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/books/">Smitten Kitchen Every Day</a>). It was when I was working on the chocolate Dutch baby that took a closer look at dutch baby formulas I’d been using and found through trial but mostly error one that I preferred.</p>
<p><a title="extra-billowy dutch baby" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/47391508342/in/photostream"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7845/47391508342_7913f4eaef_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1" alt="extra-billowy dutch baby" width="640" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" class="jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled" data-lazy-loaded="1"><noscript><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7845/47391508342_7913f4eaef_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="extra-billowy dutch baby" width="640" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></a></p>
<p>I found that an eggier batter led to a more billowy pancake. I found a little less flour and milk also increased rumples. I found that by adding the flour first, a lumpy batter was fully avoidable. I also realized that a lot of what makes a Dutch baby “work” — i.e. have a dramatic and Instagram-worthy finish — making sure you have the right amount of batter for you pan and, often, cooking it a minute or two further than merely cooked through. An extra couple minutes helps the shape of the waves set, and provides a nice crispy edge underneath.</p>

<p>On sleepy Saturday mornings, I did away with the blender and sometimes even the whisk, the stove, and even the requirement of an ovenproof skillet. I also realized that you don’t even need to choose a sweet vs. savory angle (read: break up any arguments from children who didn’t agree on flavors) before you bake the pancake. You can shower it with anything you choose after it exits the oven — sugar, lemon, fruit, or chocolate for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/47395636632/in/photostream">sweet</a> tooths; cheese, herbs, sauteed vegetables, and/or ham or bacon for savory cravings. You could make it right now; believe me, I already am.</p>
