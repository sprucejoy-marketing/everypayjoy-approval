                                            <p>You have to add a code to the end of the URL, and that will narrow down
                                                your search results.</p>
                                            <p>The code is “<strong>&amp;pct-off=</strong>” (without the quote marks)
                                                followed by the amount of discount you want to see.</p>
                                            <p>As an example, say you wanted to see only items which are discounted from
                                                40% to 70%. When you do the search, go to the end of the URL and put in
                                                “<strong>&amp;pct-off=40-70</strong>”, again without the quote marks,
                                                and it will narrow the choices.</p>

                                            <p>There is even a website that you can register with that will track the

                                            <p>You have to allow Paribus password access to your email account, and then
                                                it will review the purchase emails you receive and let you know if it

                                            <p>Here’s an interesting idea…</p>
                                            <p>try adding items you want to your shopping cart, but then don’t go
                                                through with the purchase.</p>
                                            <p>After a few days, you’ll get a reminder email from Amazon telling you
                                                that you have items left in your cart, asking you to complete your
                                                purchase.</p>
                                            <p>This is known as the “<em>shopping cart abandonment</em>” in the
                                                industry.</p>
                                           
                                            <p>Amazon, like most business, want you to buy. So, in order to entice you
                                                to go through with it, they’ll give you exclusive coupons and discounts
                                                that only people who have abounded their shopping cats will receive.</p>
                                            <p>So if you don’t mind waiting to get what you’re buying, it might be worth
                                                the wait.</p>

                                            <p>And in order to entice people to shop through them, they give some of

                                            <p>It won’t cost you a dime. And the process is basically the same. The only
                                                difference is that instead of going straight to Amazon.com (or any other

                                                link and do your shopping as usual.</p>

                                                    number on the back of card that you can call)</li>

                                                <li>Then simply enter your cards info (number and the security number on
                                                    the back) and the balance of your card and hit submit.</li>
                                                <li>You will receive your Amazon code within seconds in your email. To
                                                    use it, simply go to your account and click on “Apply a Gift Card to

                                            <p>But say you don’t want to spend $25 right now; You can pre-order
                                                something, say a game or movie that isn’t out yet, to get up to the $25
                                                limit. You won’t be charged for the preordered item until it ships.</p>
                                            <p>If you change your mind and cancel the pre-order, that doesn’t matter

                                            <p>Amazon is a great place to go to buy textbooks, and you may be able to
                                                score a deal on the used book prices. But if you’re looking at buying

                                                for the same book.</p>
                                            <p>It may be slight differences in the book from another country, but the

                                            <p>Last year, I ordered a 65 inch Samsung Smart TV. After a week of waiting
                                                and not receiving it, I contacted Amazon. They took care of the
                                                “missing” TV, sent me another one with Expedited Shipping (I got the new
                                                TV on my door step in 24 hours), and they also refunded me $75 from the
                                                original price for my “troubles”.</p>
                                            <p>Any time that your purchase is delayed beyond the delivery date you were
                                                quoted, you have the option to contact Amazon and get a shipping
                                                upgrade. If they can’t even track your order, then they’ll send you a

                                            <p>It’s not the sort of place you’d expect to find on Amazon.</p>
                                            <p>They have inventory that constantly changes, so you have to keep an eye
                                                on it or get on their newsletter list. But the things they have are
                                                usually offered at a good discount.</p>
                                            <p>For instance, at the moment, there is up to 70% off Kitchen &amp; Dining.

                                                will generally have it at a lower price.</p>

                                            <p>This means you can become an affiliate and provide links to Amazon goods,
                                                and if someone uses your link and buys you get a commission. All you
                                                need to become an affiliate is a website which you can use to post your
                                                links.</p>
                                            <p>You can’t use this directly to save yourself money, as it is against
                                                Amazon’s rules to buy through your own links and get the commission
                                                back. But say you had a friend who was interested in doing the same
                                                thing, it is possible that you could buy through his links and he could
                                                buy through yours, and you both finish up getting about 8% commission
                                                back.</p>
                                            <p>Just don’t shout about it, so they don’t change the rules!</p>

                                                    way to get free stuff</a>, but a long-term possibility.</p>
                                            <p>You may have noticed when looking at reviews that some of them are
                                                identified by a little badge, noting them as a “Vine Voice”.</p>
                                            <p>These are the elite reviewers, selected by Amazon as people who are
                                                consistently helpful in their reviews. Almost without exception, they
                                                have posted 100 or more reviews.</p>
                                            <p>When you are a Vine member, you receive regular emails notifying what
                                                goods are available for review. You can apply for the ones that interest
                                                you, but no more than two at a time and you have 30 days to submit your
                                                review.</p>
                                            <p>Popular items are taken quickly, so you have to request as soon as you
                                                see them.</p>
                                            <p>As to <a target="_blank"

                                                    reviewer</a>, there is no guaranteed path.</p>
                                            <p>If you are an active reviewer, presenting honest assessments that are
                                                also acknowledged by others checking the Helpful box, then you may be
                                                invited by Amazon.</p>
                                            <p>And if you fail to keep completing reviews, you can be dismissed from the
                                                Vine group. But it’s a good reason to leave reviews on any items you
                                                purchase, whether you buy them on Amazon or not.</p>

                                            <p>Again not guaranteed, but it often works.</p>
                                            <p>If you want to get your items quickly, but don’t want to pay for upgraded
                                                shipping for them all, try doing this…</p>
                                            <p>Order each of the items separately, one after another, but only pay to
                                                upgrade the shipping to one-day on one of them.</p>
                                            <p>Amazon will often combine orders to save its shipping costs. If you’re
                                                lucky, they will combine all your orders into one package, which you
                                                will receive on the following day.</p>

                                            <p>To catch this one, you’ll need to open two browsers on your computer, or
                                                one on your computer and one on your smartphone.</p>
                                            <p>On the first, you log into your Prime account and find the product you
                                                want, then make a note of the price.</p>
                                            <p>On the second, you can check the price of the same product after you make
                                                sure that you are not logged in as a Prime customer. You may need to
                                                clear your cookies to make sure of this.</p>
                                            <p>If the price is less than the first you were given, add the item to your
                                                cart and then log into your account before buying – the price shouldn’t

                                            <p>When you get your purchase, and you find it is damaged or broken, then
                                                you should get in touch with Amazon customer service.</p>
                                            <p>They will usually send you a replacement item right away, and may even
                                                send it overnight if you ask them.</p>
                                            <p>Even better, if the item costs less than $50 they might let you keep the
                                                damaged item at no additional cost, rather than sending it back.</p>
                                            <p>You should note, however, that this is Amazon’s policy, and applies to
                                                items sold directly by them. If you bought from a third-party supplier
                                                through Amazon, then you will be subject to their conditions, which
                                                would usually be a full refund or a replacement item with standard

                                            <p>You should know that Amazon doesn’t always show you the best price
                                                straightaway.</p>
                                            <p>For instance, if you are specific in your search, Amazon realizes that
                                                you’re probably going to buy and steers you towards its highest profit
                                                items.</p>
                                            <p>What can you do about this?</p>
                                            <p>Don’t buy the item straightaway.</p>
                                            <p>One trick is to look through the “Customers Who Bought This Item Also,”
                                                as well as the “Sponsored Products” on the product page.</p>
                                            <p>Quite often you will find the same or similar item offered at a cheaper
                                                price, available from a third-party seller.</p>

                                            <p>When it appears that Amazon doesn’t sell an item, it may simply be out of
                                                stock.</p>
                                            <p>When an item is on backorder, Amazon will show you a third-party seller,
                                                if they can ship out quicker.</p>
                                            <p>The Amazon sale link will be buried in the third-party list.</p>
                                            <p>While this will get you the item faster, it’s not necessarily the
                                                cheapest.</p>
                                            <p>You might find that the best price is offered by Amazon selling it
                                                directly, and if you’re prepared to wait for the stock to come in you
                                                will save money.</p>

                                                by a third-party seller through the Amazon website.</p>
                                            <p>The thing is, Amazon may not show you the cheapest third-party seller, as
                                                it will display a featured seller which will usually be one from the

                                            <p>If you look further, you might find another third-party seller who is not

                                                need/want, buy a gift card for a site/store that you shop from –
                                                Netflix, Google Play, Spotify, Starbucks, and even Amazon.</p>
                                            <p>And don’t forget to buy with a credit card that gets you cash back. Yes,
                                                buying gift cards from Amazon also earns you cash back.</p>

                                            <p>Amazon prices can jump around from hour to hour because there is often

                                                last an hour or two, you need fine-grained price tracking.</p>

                                            <p>Of course, the price may snap back to where it was, or go even higher.

                                                can see, it’s changed price more than 30 times in the last week – with a
                                                range from $6.99 to $13.93.</p>
                                            <p>Free price trackers tend to grab one or two price points daily, which
                                                means you miss out on a lot of what’s going on.</p>

                                                can save you money by providing more accurate data, and costs as little
                                                as $5 per month.</p>
                                            <p>Basically the savings on a single book (let alone office equipment &amp;
                                                supplies, electronics, clothes, software, games, etc) can make back the
                                                cost of the service.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Bonus tip</strong></p>
                                            <p>Buying when prices are low saves money, but you can also earn money back
                                                using a good price tracker. For re-usable items, like books, simply
                                                resell on Amazon at a good price when the price is high.</p>
                                            <p>Using our example above, you could buy The Lean Startup at $6.99. Read
                                                it. Resell it on Amazon for, say $5, meaning you only pay a dollar or
                                                two for a book that has a recommended list price of over $23.</p>
                                            <p>Not bad, right?</p>

                                            <p>Finally, here’s a way you can give to others at no cost to yourself.</p>
                                            <p>Every time you shop on Amazon, instead of going to amazon.com go to <a

                                            <p>Everything else is the same, except that 0.5% of the profit from your
                                                purchase will automatically be given to a charity of your choice (you
                                                can choose which charity when you visit Amazon Smile for the first time
                                                – you can change this later).</p>
                                            <p>On its own, 0.5% doesn’t amount to much, but when you consider how much
                                                money is spent on Amazon every year, it can become big.</p>
                                            <p>If everybody registered with Amazon Smile it would make a big difference
                                                to many worthy charities.</p>
                                            <p>This is such a simple and quick thing to do that it should be a
                                                no-brainer.</p>
                                            <p>As an animal (especially dogs) lover, I have Stray Rescue of St. Louis
                                                (an amazing organization that rescues so many abused and neglected dogs
                                                in the St Louis area) as my charity of choice. I know it’s a small
                                                thing, but it makes me feel good.</p>
                                            <p>I wish more people would do this.</p>
                                            <p>I mean, if you are buying something no matter what, and you can have a
                                                small portion of the profit they make off of your purchase go to a
                                                charity you love, why not do it.</p>
                                            <p>It’s the right thing to do!</p>
                                            <p>It doesn’t cost you anything.</p>
                                            <p>It doesn’t change anything about your shopping.</p>
                                            <p>But it makes a huge difference in the work that these awesome
                                                organizations are doing.</p>
                                            <p>And it makes you feel good inside, knowing you did something to help.</p>

                                            <p>First install the add on for your browser.</p>
                                            <p>Then every time you type in amazon.com in your browser, it automatically
