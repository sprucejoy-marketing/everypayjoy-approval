                        <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_You_Need"></span>What You Need<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
                        <p>To take online classes, you need a few basic things that most people already have.</p>
                        <p>These include:</p>
                        <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Computer"></span>Computer<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
                        <p>Obviously, to access anything online you need a computer or any other device that lets you connect to the internet.</p>
                        <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Internet"></span>Internet<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
                        <p>Having a good internet connection is important especially when it comes to taking audio and video-based classes. You don’t need a super fast internet connection but you also won’t be able to view video and audio based courses through extremely slow connections.</p>
                        <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Notebook_Pen"></span>Notebook &amp; Pen<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
                        <p>You might need to tale notes throughout lessons, so having a notebook and a pen come in handy. Although there are apps and browser add-ons that let you do the same, but if you’re not very familiar with technology, it might just be easier to jot down notes on a piece of paper.</p>
                        <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Headphones"></span>Headphones<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>
                        <p>While not absolutely necessary, a pair of headphones does make it easier to take online classes especially if you are hearing or sight-impaired. Another benefit is that you can watch and listen to courses anywhere without disturbing other people around you.</p>
                        <p>You probably already have all these things so you don’t need to spend any money shopping for “back to school” supplies.</p>

                        <p>Another great place to look for free classes for seniors near you is your city or county’s recreation department. Many of these local departments offer classes not only for kids but also for adults including people age 50 and older.</p>
                        <p>What is particularly great about attending classes thought by your local government’s recreation programs is that they may even offer classes specific to your region, like the history of your town.</p>
                        <p>To find out about current classes, just call or visit your local City Hall.</p>

                        <p>More and more colleges these days are offering online classes to keep up with the demand for space in their classrooms and to meet the needs of students with busy schedules. This, coupled with the fact that all 50 states offer some kind of waiver for tuition for students who are seniors, means that seniors can attend classes at a state institution for no cost.</p>
                        <p>It’s important to keep in mind that this isn’t a federal program and that each state has implemented its own rules as to who qualifies as a ‘senior.’ For example, in Alaska you qualify if you’re old enough to receive full Social Security benefits.</p>
